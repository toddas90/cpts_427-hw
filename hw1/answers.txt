2. The most common password is (another) 

3. Benetta has the most failed attempts (16)

4. The password salt is (selective) 

I have a program that just gets the salt then exits. Then I have another one
that I think is a lot better. It's still specific to this assignment, but it
cracks all of the passwords and prints them out instead of just finding the
salt. The executables are in their respective folders. They are compiled for
linux, and they both expect a password file and wordlist.

EX: ./executable password2.txt wordlist.txt
