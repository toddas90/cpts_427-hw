Answer: Sundiver
Shift right 8.
I copied the text into the solver. I knew it was probably a caesar cipher
because it was said to be a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

Decryption alphabet: IJKDGLMNEOPXRCSTUHAVBFWZYQ
Encryption alphabet: SUNDIVERABCFGHJKZMOPQTWLYX
I found this neat decryptor website. I found the alphabets using it by copying
a small snippet of the text into it. Then I wrote a python script (q2.py) to
decrypt the entire text and write the output to (q2ans.txt).
